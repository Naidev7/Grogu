Welcome to the Mandalorian Delivery Mission repository! This project is a collaborative effort to develop an animated game frontend using React.

## Project Overview
In this game, you'll join the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, also known as "the Mandalorian" or simply "Mando," as he travels through the galaxy with Grogu, completing various missions. This time, the mission is very special. Mando must deliver unfertilized frog eggs, blue cookies (so delicious!), and some frogs to establish contact with Ahsoka Tano.

The objective is to deliver the cargo to a contact on the planet Nevarro. This contact will provide us with information about Ahsoka's whereabouts, which we'll use to attempt to persuade her to become Grogu's Jedi master. However, there's a catch â€“ our contact has made it clear that if the merchandise doesn't arrive, there's no deal.

Mando has heard great things about your skills in safeguarding merchandise, so he's decided to hire you to ensure everything goes smoothly. Help Mando achieve his goal, and you'll be rewarded handsomely.

## Features
Guide Mando's ship through various obstacles and challenges.
Deliver the cargo safely to the designated contact on Nevarro.
Navigate through different levels of increasing difficulty.
Enjoy the immersive experience with Mandalorian-themed animations and graphics.
